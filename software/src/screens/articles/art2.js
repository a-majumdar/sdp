          The sunflower is one of the nation’s best-loved flowers. Although most sunflower varieties have yellow flowers, sunflowers also have rusty red, green and forms with white flowers.

Annual sunflowers bloom from summer into autumn. Depending on the variety, they can take 11-18 weeks to flower from seed sowing. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to sow sunflower seed every couple of weeks, so you’ll have a constant supply of cheerful sunflowers throughout summer.

Sunflowers are easy to grow from seed and are ideal for growing with children.They can grow to heights of up to two metres, bear impressive, long-lasting flowers, and look fantastic in gardens and allotments. They make an excellent cut flower.
Did you know? Sunflowers are related to Jerusalem artichokes, Helianthus tuberosus. If you plant Jerusalem artichokes and let them flower, they will bear beautiful, sunflower-like blooms.

To grow sunflowers you need a sunny, sheltered spot and a good soil – add plenty of well-rotted manure or garden compost before planting, if you can. Protect the young plants from slugs and snails and water your sunflowers regularly. You may also need to stake them if they’re in an exposed position.

Choose your variety carefully as some sunflowers will grow 50cm, while others grow over 3m. Sow seeds in pots from April and plant out when all risk of frost has passed. Prepare the soil well and add plenty of organic matter to the planting hole. Keep your sunflowers well watered and feed weekly to encourage them to grow tall. You may need to stake some of the taller varieties.
