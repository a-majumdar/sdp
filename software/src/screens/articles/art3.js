            Start with healthy plants. Whether homegrown or store-bought, plants
            should be short and stocky (6 to 10 in. tall). Avoid plants with
            blossoms or fruit. You'll pay more for plants in individual 4-in.
            pots, but they usually have larger root systems than those growing
            in cell packs. As a result, they will grow faster after
            transplanting. Choose the right site. Tomatoes grow best in full sun
            (at least 8 hours daily) and well-drained soil rich in organic
            matter. Work a couple inches of compost or decomposed manure into
            the upper 6 in. of soil prior to planting. If a soil test shows the
            pH is below 6.0, apply lime.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Plant right. Set plants in the garden after the danger of frost and
            when the soil temperatures are above 60Â°F. (Experienced gardeners
            sometimes plant earlier and shelter plants to protect them from cold
            and frost.)
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Space plants 1 1/2 to 3 ft. apart (closer for determinate varieties,
            which spread less). Wide spacing assures good air circulation, which
            discourages diseases.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Plant seedlings in the ground deeper than they were growing in their
            pots so the lowest leaves are just above the soil level. Roots will
            grow along the length of the buried stem, resulting in stronger
            plants. And, don't forget to water freshly planted seedlings. Most
            experts recommend fertilizing at planting time. But go easy on the
            fertilizer. In this case, less is best because too much nitrogen
            fertilizer results in vigorous vines with few tomatoes. The
            recommendation from Clemson University Extension is fairly standard:
            Pour about 1 pint of starter solution (2 tbs. of 10-10-10 or 5-10-5
            fertilizer per gallon of water) around each plant.
